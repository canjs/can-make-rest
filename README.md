## Usage

### ES6 use

With StealJS, you can import this module directly in a template that is autorendered:

```js
import plugin from 'can-make-rest';
```

### CommonJS use

Use `require` to load `can-make-rest` and everything else
needed to create a template that uses `can-make-rest`:

```js
var plugin = require("can-make-rest");
```

### Standalone use

Load the `global` version of the plugin:

```html
<script src='./node_modules/can-make-rest/dist/global/can-make-rest.js'></script>
